# Getting and cleaning data

## Modifications
The data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository was modified by:
- Combining both test and training data into one data set
- Removing all data except the means and standard deviations which were relevant for this assignment
- Adding descriptive names to measurements and activity types
- Using the means and standard deviations to create an average for each measurement for each combination of subjectID and activity


## Identifiers
The final data set contains the following measurements
activityName The name for the activity the subject was undertaking during the observation (character)
subjectID The identifier for the subject (integer)
